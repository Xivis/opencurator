# Open Curator

Open Curator is a dApp that allows to curate multiple Token Curated Registries (TCRs) in a single place. We designed and developed a TCR standard that enables the creation of new TCRs within the app and also enables integration with existing ones.

A Token Curated Registry (or TCR) is an incentivized voting game that helps create trusted lists that are maintained by the very people that use them. Using the “Wisdom of the Crowds” principle, users collectively vote (using tokens) to decide which submissions are valid and should be included in the list. 

**What we propose**

[TCR standard <EIP-TBD>](https://github.com/Xivis/opencurator/blob/master/EIP/eip-920-TCR_standar.md)
:scroll:One standard to curate them all:scroll:

**What the dApp does**

- Create & customize curated lists: hack the implementation to fit your use-case by using our pre-set schemas and smart contracts. 
- Navigate and curate existing implementations of TCRs that implements the standard.
- Propose new items.
- Challenge the items that don't really belong.
- Be a curator: Vote on active challenges and earn rewards for signaling your good taste.

**Inspiration**

We want to make TCRs work as they are intended for!

**What's next for Open Curator**

- Get feedback from the community.
- Propose new implementations of the standard that fit to new use-cases challenges.
- Karma tokens: a native token that represents reputation, you won't be able to trade it, you will only be able to earn it by curating legit content. This token will enable cool features like: access control to specific actions (ex. only curators with more than X karma can propose new items to this list).
